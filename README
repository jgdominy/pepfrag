This code is avaialble under the Gnu General Public License v3 or higher. For
more information, please see the file COPYING which should have been provided
with the rest of the project files.

This project contains three scripts:

pepfrag.py	The main project code, run without arguments for instructions
mutate.py	Used to generate mutated sequences for testing
reassamble.py	Used for round trip testing; Piping the output of pepfrag 
		into reassmble should output fasta files identical to those 
		used as input to pepfrag, but for intra-sequence line breaks

There is also a sequences subdirectory, in which there is a Makefile. Running
make in this directory will run a series of tests which may take some time (2
days on an 8 core 2.5Ghz machine using 'make -j 7'). These tests can and should
be run in parallel using -j N, where N is the number of free cores you have.

The Makefile reproduces the results found in the published paper.
