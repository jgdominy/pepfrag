This project contains three scripts:

pepfrag.py	The main project code, run without arguments for instructions
mutate.py	Used to generate mutated sequences for testing
reassamble.py	Used for round trip testing; Piping the output of pepfrag 
		into reassmble should output fasta files identical to those 
		used as input to pepfrag, but for intra-sequence line breaks

There is also a sequences subdirectory, in which there is a Makefile. Running
make in this directory will run a series of tests which may take some time (2
days on an 8 core 2.5Ghz machine using 'make -j 7'). These tests can and should
be run in parallel using -j N, where N is the number of free cores you have.

The Makefile reproduces the results found in the published paper, as well as
others.
