This project contains three scripts:

pepfrag		The main project code, run without arguments for instructions.
		This file can be created by running 'make' in the main
		directory.
mutate.py	Used to generate mutated sequences for testing
reassamble.py	Used for round trip testing; Piping the output of pepfrag 
		into reassmble should output fasta files identical to those 
		used as input to pepfrag, but for intra-sequence line breaks

There is also a sequences subdirectory. Running 'make test' in the main
directory will run a series of tests which may take some time (3 days on an 8
core 2.5Ghz machine using 'make -j 3'). These tests can and should be run in
parallel using -j N, where N is the number of free cores you have.

The Makefile reproduces the results found in the published paper.
